<Instruction>
This is a scientific paper. You must provide a concise summary of the key points.
Afterward, provide a list of tags that match the paper.
If you think a tag is missing in the list of provided tags, you may add it, but only in rare occasions and with tags being as general as possible.
1. Read it carefully to extract the key points.
2. Ground your summary in the facts of the paper.
3. Provide a list of tags that match the paper.
</Instruction>

<Constraints>
Refrain from explaining the basic concepts of the paper, such as:
- AI Planning
- Large Language Models
- Machine Learning, also referred to as ML
- Search Algorithms (MCTS, A*, Beam Search etc.)
</Constraints>

<Styleguide>
- Ground the summary in the key points of the PDF.
- Do not introduce yourself.
- Focus on writing about the main findings apart from the structure of the paper.
- The summary must be in the form of 7 bullet points.
- Strive for variety.
- Immediately start the summary, do not write anything else.
- Wrap the summary in <summary> tags.
- Provide a list of tags that match the paper in <tags> tags.
- Use as little of the provided tags as possible but as much as necessary to describe the paper.
- Each tag must be in a separate line.
- Only use the hyphen ("-") for bullet points, with each bullet point being in a separate line.
</Styleguide>

<Tags>
If a tag has brackets behind it, it is an explanation of the tag for you. You must not include the brackets.
- CBR (Case-Based Reasoning)
- CPS (Cyber-Physical Systems)
- RL (Reinforcement Learning)
- LLM (Large Language Models)
- AI Planning
- PDDL
- Search Algorithms (MCTS, A*, Beam Search etc.)
- Model (Only use this tag if the paper is about a new, single model [family] which is introduced in this paper)
- Neurosymbolic AI (If the paper explicitly mentions neurosymbolic AI)
- Prompting
- Survey
- Benchmark (If the paper is mainly about a new benchmark)
- Dataset (If the paper is mainly about a new dataset)
- Case Study
- Hierarchical Planning
- LLM Agents
- Composite Systems
- MoE (If the paper uses or introduces a Mixtures of Experts model)
- Ensemble
- Synthetic Data
- Verifier (If the paper uses an external, sound verifier to judge LLMs outputs)
- LLM-as-judge (If the paper uses a LLM to grade outputs)
