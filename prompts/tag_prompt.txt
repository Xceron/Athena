Each tags must be in a separate line with each line starting with a hyphen ("-").


<Tags>
If a tag has brackets behind it, it is an explanation of the tag for you. You must not include the brackets.

- BPMN
- RL (Reinforcement Learning)
- LLM (Large Language Models)
- AI Planning (If the paper explicitly mentions symbolic planning, such as PDDL, HTL, Lean or others)
- PDDL
- Search Algorithms (MCTS, A*, Beam Search etc.)
